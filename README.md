# Deconvolution of Bulk RNA-Seq
Basil Khuder

-------
Being able to determine cellular heteorgenity in Bulk RNA-Seq data is possible through deconvolution. By taking a scRNA-Seq dataset made 
up of cells of similiar tissue, we can find marker genes that will help significantly differentiate our bulk sample. 

*deconvolute.py* contains functions that will normalize single-cell datasets and find X amount of marker genes to be used to
deconvolute the bulk sample.
